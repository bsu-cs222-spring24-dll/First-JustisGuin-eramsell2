Ethan Ramsell -- Justis Guin

Summary:
The program first asks the user to input the name of a Wikipedia article. Next, the program checks for errors and then the API connects to Wikipedia and grabs the edit history of the requested page. 
The edit history is parsed to JSON data and then a list of the timestamps and usernames of the last 14 revisions are printed.
